# On testing
- Find ways your code might break and try to break it.
- If you do not find these someone else will.
- Test code with other data (not just one source).

### Criteria for testing
1. Outlying values at both the high and low ends.
2. Outlying values at the low end only.
3. Outlying values at the high end only.
4. No outlying values.
5. Only outlying values (no valid ones).
6. An empty dataset.

# Algorithms
Shorter code usually indicated great crafted code.

<strong>Big-O notation and time complexity</strong><br><br>

#### Questions
1. How much time does it take to run this function?
- Very hard to answer (many variables to consider)
2. How does the runtime of this function grow?
- Runtime = time it takes to execute a piece of code
- Use Big O Notation and time complexity to find out

#### Patterns
Time complexity = a way of showing how the runtime of a function
increases
1. Linear time
2. Constant time
3. Quadratic time

## Function signatures
The definition of a function including the name and the parameters that
it defines.

## Tuples
- An ordered set of data
